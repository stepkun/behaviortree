/// A `Sequence` ticks its children in an ordered sequence from first to last.
/// If any child returns [`BehaviorState::Running`], previous children will NOT be ticked again.
/// - If any child returns [`BehaviorState::Failure`] the sequence returns [`BehaviorState::Failure`].
/// - If all children return [`BehaviorState::Success`] the sequence returns [`BehaviorState::Success`].
/// - While any child returns [`BehaviorState::Running`] the sequence returns [`BehaviorState::Running`].
///
/// It implements 2 modes, which differ in how they handle a childs success:
/// - The synchronous mode will tick all children within one tick from its parent.
/// - The asynchronous mode will return the flow contol after a childs success to its parent
///   returning [`BehaviorState::Running`] and continue with the next child at the next tick from parent.
///
/// While running, the loop is not restarted, first the running child will be ticked again.
/// If that tick succeeds the sequence continues, children that already succeeded will not be ticked again.
///
/// Examples:
/// <Sequence>
///    <Behavior1/>
///    <Behavior2/>
///    <Behavior3/>
/// </Sequence>
///
/// Requires a factory at least `with_core_behaviors` or manual registration
