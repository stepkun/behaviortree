/// The `ForceState` behavior is used to return a certain state, independant of what the child returned.
/// - If child returns Failure or Success, this behavior returns the stored [`BehaviorState`].
/// - If child returns any other state, that state will be returned.

/// This [`Decorator`] is used to provide the decorators that enforce a certain response, independant from the childs result like
/// `ForceFailure` and `ForceSuccess`.
///
/// The behavior is gated behind feature `force_state`.
/// There are the predefined variants
/// - ForceFailure: gated behind feature `force_failure`
/// - ForceRunning: gated behind feature `force_running`
/// - ForceSuccess: gated behind feature `force_success`
