/// The `RetryUntilSuccessful` decorator is used to execute a child several times if it fails.

/// If the child returns Success, the loop is stopped and this decorator
/// returns Success.
///
/// If the child returns Failure, this decorator will try again up to N times
/// (N is read from port `num_attempts`).
///
/// This decorator is non-reactive and does all attempts within 1 tick.
///
/// Example:
///
/// ```xml
/// <RetryUntilSuccessful num_attempts="3">
///     <OpenDoor/>
/// </RetryUntilSuccessful>
/// ```
